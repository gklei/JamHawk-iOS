	When the user is interacting with the main player, there are two key points:
	1. Updates to the player are being made (e.g. filter selection)
	2. Status updates are being made (needsMedia = true)

	We need to regulate calls being made to the server by using an interval for server updates. We'll track events
	that are triggered by the user (treating the 'next_track' event as a special case)
*/

/*
	Status
		playerID - X
		requestID - X
		needInstance - false
		needMedia - gets set to true when the user requests the next track
		needNext - gets set to true when the filter selection changes
		needFilters - flase

	Updates
		filter - null means that there are no updates
		select - next song id
		ratings - queued up
